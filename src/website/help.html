  <h1 class="title">Measurements</h1>
  <h2 class="subtitle">What is a spinorama set of graphs?</h2>
  <p>
    It is a way to understand quickly a speaker properties, how it
    will sound. It is defined
    in <a href="https://shop.cta.tech/products/standard-method-of-measurement-for-in-home-loudspeakers">this
    standard</a> from the USA CTA.

    Here is an example:
  </p>
  <img src="speakers/Genelec%208341A/ASR/asr-vertical/CEA2034.jpg"
       width="600"
       alt="spinorama from a Genelec 8341A"/>
  <p>
    The spinorama gives you a few graphs:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>On Axis:</b> this the frequency response of the speaker on axis. You expect it to
      be as flat as possible above 100Hz.</li>
    <li><b>Listening Window:</b> this an average of various
    measurements around on axis. The idea is that it is closer to real
    life since your head is always moving a bit in practice and you
    are not staying frozen in front on the speakers. It is expected to
    be close to the previous one, slighlty going down.</li>
    <li><b>Early reflections:</b> expected to be a smooth, slowy going
      down line.</li>
    <li><b>Sound power:</b> expected to be a smooth, slowy going
    down line (slope is greater than Early Reflections).</li>
    <li><b>ERDI and SPDI:</b> are the difference between the Early
    Reflection curve and the Listening Window (resp. Sound Power and
    Listening Window). This should be as straight as possible above
    100 Hz. If the DI curves are flat, you will be able to correct the
    frequency aberations of your speaker easily. It is important to
    understand that a bad directivy cannot be corrected with a IIR eq.
  </ul>
  <p>The speaker above is <i>very</i> good. You can compare with
    another one:</p>
  <img src="speakers/Tannoy%20Revolution%20XT6/ASR/asr/CEA2034.jpg"
       width="600"
       alt="spinorama for a Tannoy XT6"/>
  <p>which is not flat at all. Remember that &plusmn;3dB means that the
  volume doubles/halves at the corresponding frequency. If you look at
    the on axis measurement below, you see that it going up, the
    speaker will likely be bright and emphasis high frequency.</p>

  <h1 class="title">FAQ</h1>

  <h2 class="title">Can I trust the data?</h2>
  The measurements are collected on the internet. Some are of very
  high quality and done by independant reviewers, some are of medium
  or low quality or provided by vendors.

  <p>You can filter the results by clicking the wheel on the website near
    the search bar.</p>

    <img
      src="help_pictures/help_select_high_quality.jpg"
      alt="How to filter on high quality measurements"/>
  </picture>

  <h2 class="title">How precise are the measurement data?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><i>High quality</i> data: provided by a Klippel NFS or measured in a large
      anechoic chamber. Data precision is around 1%.
    </li>
    <li><i>Medium quality</i> data: medium size anechoc chamber, data
      precision decreases &lt;500Hz. By how much is unknown.
    </li>
    <li><i>Low quality</i> data:
      <ul>
        <li>measured without an anechoic chamber but
          using windowing for high frequency and plane ground method for low
          frequency. Precision can be as good as a Klippel
          measurements.
        </li>
        <li>provided by vendors: usually smoothed data (less
          measurement points, or data is smoothed, or quality is just
          unknown). Smoothed
          measurements <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/new-set-of-graphs-for-all-speakers-reviews.11373/page-5#post-742037">usually
          generate</a> a score
          which higher by 0.7 on average over a score computed raw
          data. Note that the 0.7 can change depending on the amount
          of smoothing and other factors.

        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="title">How precise are the computed data?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Generally precision depends on the quality of the input
    data. If you want to compare 2 measurements, you should select
      them from the same category.
    </li>
    <li>Score computations
      <ul>
        <li>The score is not significant &pm;0.5. It means that 2
        speakers which have a difference in score less than 1 are in
          the same broad bucket. No point to look at the decimals.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <li>Anechoic EQ computations
      <ul>
        <li>EQ is for one measurement. Since there are variations
        speaker to speaker, you should not look at very sharp or very
        precise EQ. How much variation between speakers? This is very
        brand/model dependant. Some manufactures provide tolerance
          like Neumann or Genelec.
        </li>
        <li>IIR eq (aka PEQs) are not working if the phase is varying
        a lot over some frequency range. Group delay (phase
        derivative) must be relatively flat. That may explain why EQing
        around the crossover frequency does not necessary give
        excellent results. On this other side, we are less sensitive
        to phase anomaly than frequency anomaly.
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="title">Can I use this data to decide which speaker to buy</h2>
  See dedicated section.

  <h2 class="title">Should I use room EQ?</h2>
  Absolutly! Dirac, REW, Audyssey etc will provide audible
  improvement to the sound, in general making it flatter (so more
  tonally correct).

  <h2 class="title">Focus or broad radiation pattern?</h2>
  Speakers do not radiate uniformly. Some speakers are designed to be
  very focus: they minimise the reflections but the sweet spot is very
  tiny. Some speakers are designed to diffuse sound, research proved
  it is something that people usually like.

  If you are near field, for example on a desk, low directivity works
  well. The farther from the speaker you are, the more good
  directivity becomes important. If the room is reflective, this is
  especially important.

<section class="content">
  <h1>How to select your speaker?</h1>
  That is a polemic section, I know, I know.


  <h2>Criteria</h2>
  I believe there are a few criteria in whatever order you want:
  <ul>
    <li>Price:
      <p>Price is not linked to quality (sadly) and is a factor where
      you are the only judge of the worthiness.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Design:
      <p>Design is to each is own. Some like monkey coffins, some like
        studio monitors, some like big horns, it is up to you</p>
    </li>
    <li>Build quality:
      <p>Some brands built to high standars some don't. Do some due
        diligence.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Support quality:
      <p>Who can or will repair your speaker if you have an issue?
      How long do they store parts? How long is the guarantee? What
      is covered. It is worth a close look if you buy once in a
      lifetime expensive speakers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Tonality:
      <p>Here we have more concensus, a lot of people like the same
      thing. To be HIFI, you want to have a speaker with a high
      tonality score. This score takes into account flatness,
      directivity and how much bass you will get.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>SPL aka Sound Power level:
      <p>How loud do you want your speaker to be? It depends a lot of
        your room and at which level you want to listen.</p>
      Some examples:
      <ul>
        <li>Bedroom 3m x 4m, listening distance &lt;2m, 73dB reference
        level, +20 dB for peak: 93dB at 1 meter. Around 90dB per
                                                     speaker.
        </li>
        <li>Living room 6m x 8m, listening distance &lt;3m, 73dB reference
        level, +20 dB for peak: 93dB at 1 meter. Around 96dB per speaker.
        </li>
        <li>Large room or studio 7m x 12m, listening distance &lt;5m, 73dB reference
        level, +20 dB for peak: 93dB at 1 meter. Around 116dB per speaker.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Bass extension:
      <p>Small speakers dont have much bass. You need a subwoofer or a
      large speaker if you want both deep bass and high volume. New
      speakers with DSP can produce a lot of bass while being small
      but not at high volume. If you listen to music only and do not
      like electronic music, you dont need subwoofers with large speakers.
      </p>
      Some examples:
      <ul>
        <li>Bedroom 3m x 4m, one 10 inch subwoofer. </li>
        <li>Living room 6m x 8m, one 15 inch subwoofer or two 12 inch subwoofers</li>
        <li>Large room or studio 7m x 12m, two 15 inch subwoofers, may
          be more</li>
      </ul>
      You can choose floorstanders or bookshelves with
      subwoofers. Integration is not very easy but very doable
      especially if you use an AVR. Most people like bass, your
      neighbourgh may not like <i>your</i> bass.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How good is your room?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Is the room dedicated to music?</li>
    <li>Is the room symmetrical?</li>
    <li>Does the room have some absorption?</li>
    <li>Did you add panels to control reflections?</li>
    <li>Did you have multiple subwoofers to control bass linearity?</li>
    <li>Did you measured your speakers in your room?</li>
  </ul>

  If you did not answer yes each times, then you do not need the best
  speakers in the world and obsessing over scores, SPL etc will not
  make it the best room in the world.

  At the same time, I understand very well the attraction of having a
  great pair of speakers.

  Speakers with a high tonality score will be easier to EQ and will
  adapt well to your room. Define the SPL you want (at 1% distorsion)
  and now you have reasonable choices.
