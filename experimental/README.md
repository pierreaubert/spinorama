# Here are a collections of *experimental* scripts.

Experimental means that they may not work (usually they do have bugs, they have not have been updated to the last  version)...

- **3d3a_load**: how to load data from 3d3a

- **3d3a**: load and display graphs from 3d3a

- **compare**: code to compare graphs of 2 different speakers

- **compare2**: compute directivity angles vertical and horizontal from a contour plot

- **composition**: 1 pager to understand how to use altair to make graphs composed of other graphs

- **contour_movie**: takes on the contour plot and generate a quick movie out of them, didn't work as expected.

- **contour**: old code to generate contour plots

- **estimates**: old code to compute parameters from graphs (-3dB point, flatness etc)

- **filters_iir**: old code to generate IIR filters

- **filters_optim1**: old code to find optimal IIR filters

- **filters_optim2**: old code to find optimal IIR filters (different strategy)

- **filters**: old code to find optimal IIR filters (yet other algorithm)

- **image**: how to integrate a picture inside an altair graph

- **isobands**: altair, how to plot isobands?

- **isolines**: altair, how to plot isolines?

- **olive**: compute some parameters from paper Olive&all

- **optim_visual**: visualize speed of convergence for optimisation algorithms. Obsolete now use tensorboard.

- **optimal_angle**: Find the optimal angle (toe-ing) to get the best in room response. This is a failed experiment, please ignore.

- **perf_filter**: compare various functions to compute IIR filters and select the fastest

- **play_3d**: use plotly to make 3d nice looking graphs for contours

- **play_altair**: some experiments with altair library

- **play_astropy**: some tests with astropy library

- **play_axis**: altair: how to make nice axis

- **play_drc**: prototype of DRC system

- **play_iir_fir**: matplotlib: show some freq/phase graphs

- **play_model**: model a loudspeakers, currently using IIR filters, switching to FIR filters

- **play_optim**: use ray to tune parameters for IIR optimisation

- **play_phase**: compute group delay, minimum_phase and excess phase

- **play_radar**: radar plots with Altair

- **play_smmothing**:

  - compute the effect of smmoothing the graphs on the pref score
  - can we penalize the pref score if data are too smooth? by how much?

- **play_starplot**: failed experiment to make nice looking star plot with Altair/Vega

- **play_tf_iir**: failed experiement with  TF and IIR optimisation

- **play_wolfram**: play with Wolfram engine

- **polar**: how to make polar plots with Altair

- **polygons**: algorithm to compute polygons intersection. Unfinished, bugs with holes ... not too far from a proper result.

- **presentation**: Altair test to write a table of text on 2 columns

- **radar**: how to make radar plot with Altair.

- **scores**: old code to compute preference score for speakers

- **show_eqs**: display all the EQs as graph

- **spinorama**: old code to compute and display spinorama graphs

- **weights**: formula to compute the weigths from the CEA2034 standars
