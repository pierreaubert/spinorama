# 🔨 Phase 3 Playbook — Build & Iterate

> **Duration**: 2-12 weeks (varies by scope) | **Agents**: 15-30+ | **Gate Keeper**: Agents Orchestrator

---

## Objective

Implement all features through continuous Dev↔QA loops. Every task is validated before the next begins. This is where the bulk of the work happens — and where NEXUS's orchestration delivers the most value.

## Pre-Conditions

- [ ] Phase 2 Quality Gate passed (foundation verified)
- [ ] Sprint Prioritizer backlog available with RICE scores
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline operational
- [ ] Design system and component library ready
- [ ] API scaffold with auth system ready

## The Dev↔QA Loop — Core Mechanic

The Agents Orchestrator manages every task through this cycle:

```
FOR EACH task IN sprint_backlog (ordered by RICE score):

  1. ASSIGN task to appropriate Developer Agent (see assignment matrix)
  2. Developer IMPLEMENTS task
  3. Evidence Collector TESTS task
     - Visual screenshots (desktop, tablet, mobile)
     - Functional verification against acceptance criteria
     - Brand consistency check
  4. IF verdict == PASS:
       Mark task complete
       Move to next task
     ELIF verdict == FAIL AND attempts < 3:
       Send QA feedback to Developer
       Developer FIXES specific issues
       Return to step 3
     ELIF attempts >= 3:
       ESCALATE to Agents Orchestrator
       Orchestrator decides: reassign, decompose, defer, or accept
  5. UPDATE pipeline status report
```

| Whimsy Injector | Feature needs delight/personality | UX review identifies opportunity |
| Visual Storyteller | Visual narrative content needed | Content requires visual assets |
| Brand Guardian | Brand consistency concern | QA finds brand deviation |
| XR Interface Architect | Spatial interaction design needed | XR feature requires UX guidance |
| Data Analytics Reporter | Deep data analysis needed | Feature requires analytics integration |

## Parallel Build Tracks

For NEXUS-Full deployments, four tracks run simultaneously:

### Track A: Core Product Development
```
Managed by: Agents Orchestrator (Dev↔QA loop)
Agents: Frontend Developer, Backend Architect, AI Engineer,
        Mobile App Builder, Senior Developer
QA: Evidence Collector, API Tester, Test Results Analyzer

Sprint cadence: 2-week sprints
Daily: Task implementation + QA validation
End of sprint: Sprint review + retrospective
```

### Track B: Growth & Marketing Preparation
```
Managed by: Project Shepherd
Agents: Growth Hacker, Content Creator, Social Media Strategist,
        App Store Optimizer

Sprint cadence: Aligned with Track A milestones
Activities:
- Growth Hacker → Design viral loops and referral mechanics
- Content Creator → Build launch content pipeline
- Social Media Strategist → Plan cross-platform campaign
- App Store Optimizer → Prepare store listing (if mobile)
```

### Track C: Quality & Operations
```
Managed by: Agents Orchestrator
Agents: Evidence Collector, API Tester, Performance Benchmarker,
        Workflow Optimizer, Experiment Tracker

Continuous activities:
- Evidence Collector → Screenshot QA for every task
- API Tester → Endpoint validation for every API task
- Performance Benchmarker → Periodic load testing
- Workflow Optimizer → Process improvement identification
- Experiment Tracker → A/B test setup for validated features
```

### Track D: Brand & Experience Polish
```
Managed by: Brand Guardian
Agents: UI Designer, Brand Guardian, Visual Storyteller,
        Whimsy Injector

Triggered activities:
- UI Designer → Component refinement when QA identifies visual issues
- Brand Guardian → Periodic brand consistency audit
- Visual Storyteller → Visual narrative assets as features complete
- Whimsy Injector → Micro-interactions and delight moments
```

## Sprint Execution Template

### Sprint Planning (Day 1)

```
Sprint Prioritizer activates:
1. Review backlog with updated RICE scores
2. Select tasks for sprint based on team velocity
3. Assign tasks to developer agents
4. Identify dependencies and ordering
5. Set sprint goal and success criteria

Output: Sprint Plan with task assignments
```

### Daily Execution (Day 2 to Day N-1)

```
Agents Orchestrator manages:
1. Current task status check
2. Dev↔QA loop execution
3. Blocker identification and resolution
4. Progress tracking and reporting

Status report format:
- Tasks completed today: [list]
- Tasks in QA: [list]
- Tasks in development: [list]
- Blocked tasks: [list with reason]
- QA pass rate: [X/Y]
```

### Sprint Review (Day N)

```
Project Shepherd facilitates:
1. Demo completed features
2. Review QA evidence for each task
3. Collect stakeholder feedback
4. Update backlog based on learnings

Participants: All active agents + stakeholders
Output: Sprint Review Summary
```

### Sprint Retrospective

```
Workflow Optimizer facilitates:
1. What went well?
2. What could improve?
3. What will we change next sprint?
4. Process efficiency metrics

Output: Retrospective Action Items
```

## Orchestrator Decision Logic

### Task Failure Handling

```
WHEN task fails QA:
  IF attempt == 1:
    → Send specific QA feedback to developer
    → Developer fixes ONLY the identified issues
    → Re-submit for QA
    
  IF attempt == 2:
    → Send accumulated QA feedback
    → Consider: Is the developer agent the right fit?
    → Developer fixes with additional context
    → Re-submit for QA
    
  IF attempt == 3:
    → ESCALATE
    → Options:
      a) Reassign to different developer agent
      b) Decompose task into smaller sub-tasks
      c) Revise approach/architecture
      d) Accept with known limitations (document)
      e) Defer to future sprint
    → Document decision and rationale
```

### Parallel Task Management

```
WHEN multiple tasks have no dependencies:
  → Assign to different developer agents simultaneously
  → Each runs independent Dev↔QA loop
  → Orchestrator tracks all loops concurrently
  → Merge completed tasks in dependency order

WHEN task has dependencies:
  → Wait for dependency to pass QA
  → Then assign dependent task
  → Include dependency context in handoff
```
